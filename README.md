## **Note**
While the _`VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD`_ argument is optional, it is not if you are using the macOS VNC viewer. If you do not set a password on macOS, you will not be able to connect to the container‚Äôs VNC server.

This container has a non-root user **_apps_** created in Dockerfile , root passwd =_docker_

Please check if your GUI app needed `--privileged` flag , as some popular apps like chrome need it
